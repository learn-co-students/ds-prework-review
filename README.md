# Python Review

Hello! This content is intended to review the Python you practiced in the Pre-Work.

You will practice: 

- Assigning variables
- Classifying and explaining data types (integers, floats, strings, booleans, lists, dictionaries, and tuples)
- Identifying comparators and boolean operators to create conditional code
- Making use of lists: indexing, appending, and joining them
- Making use of dictionaries: identifying, creating, and navigating them
- Moving between lists and dictionaries (zipping lists together to make dictionaries, or pulling relevant data from a dictionary into a list)
- Applying for loops to lists and dictionaries

Some new things we'll bring up that you might not have seen before:

- Using f-strings or .format() to print readable code with variables
- Using .zip() to combine two lists into a dictionary
